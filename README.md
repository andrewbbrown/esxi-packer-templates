# VMware [ESXi](https://www.vmware.com/products/esxi-and-esx/overview) [Packer](http://packer.io) templates


## Prerequisites

* [Packer](http://packer.io) > 0.8
* VMware Fusion or Workstation

## Build artifacts

This packer template requires to variables to be set either via command line or separate JSON file:

1. `iso_file` - is the ESXi ISO for the build (can be local or remote).

To kick off a full build:

```shell
packer build \
       -var 'iso_file=iso/VMware-VMvisor-Installer-6.0.0-2494585.x86_64.iso' \
       packer-esxi.json
```

The Packer template and the scripts have been tested with ESXi version 5.5 and 6.0.

Default `root` password for the resulting Vagrant box is `vagrant`.

There is a convenience script provided to build a known version of the vagrant box.

```shell
./build-6.0.0.update01.sh
```
